# Spring Cloud Alibaba Sentinel

Sentinel has the following features:

- Rich Scenarios： Sentinel has supported the key scenarios of Alibaba’s Double 11 Shopping Festivals for over 10 years, such as second kill(i.e., controlling sudden bursts of traffic flow so that it’s within the acceptable range of the system capacity), message load shifting, circuit breaking of unreliable downstream applications.
- Comprehensive Real-Time Monitoring： Sentinel provides real-time monitoring capability. You can see the monitoring data of your servers at the accuracy of seconds, and even the overall runtime status of a cluster with less than 500 nodes.
- Extensive Open-Source Ecosystem： Sentinel provides out-of-box modules that can be easily integrated with other open-source frameworks/libraries, such as Spring Cloud, Dubbo, and gRPC. To use Sentinel, you only need to introduce the related dependency and make a few simple configurations.
- Sound SPI Extensions： Sentinel provides easy-to-use and sound SPI extension interfaces. You can customize logics with the SPI extensions quickly, for example, you can define your own rule management, or adapt to specific data sources.
